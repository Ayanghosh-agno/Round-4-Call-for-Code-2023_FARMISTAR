### The Issue we are hoping to solve <a name="issue-we-are-solving"></a>

FARMISTAR addresses critical sustainability challenges in agriculture. Firstly, it enhances resource efficiency by leveraging AI to optimize crop yield and recommend suitable crops and fertilizers, thereby reducing unnecessary resource usage and promoting sustainable farming practices. Secondly, it aids in weather-based decision-making, allowing farmers to adapt to changing climate conditions and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on their crops. Thirdly, FARMISTAR promotes fair trade and supports small-scale farmers by providing a marketplace for their produce, ensuring a sustainable source of income. Finally, it streamlines communication and issue resolution through either web-to-case system, web chatbot, whatsapp chatbot or through IVR, fostering better farmer-farmer and farmer-service provider interactions, ultimately contributing to the sustainability and resilience of agriculture in the face of modern challenges.
